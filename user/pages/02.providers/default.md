### Adding Attachments (Patient Documents) <a id="chapter-5"></a>
Attachments are PDF documents which can be automatically attached to requisitions that you create.
This comes in handy when you need to attach insurance information or medication lists to a requisition.

Adding Patient Documents/Attachments can be done from the "Edit Patients" menu.
You should see a tab called "Attachments/Documents" - click this tab to see any attachments the patient has as well
as add some new documents.

### Creating Orders <a id="chapter-6"></a>
Things you will need to create an order:
1. An existing Patient
2. Collection Date, Collector's Name/Initials
3. Diagnosis Codes
4. Optionally, you can include any Medications you wish to declare 
5. Tests and Panels you are requesting

Once you have all the required things, creating an order is very straightforward.
Enter the information required, then click "Save Order and Create Requisition" - or, you can just click "Save Order"
if you are not finished creating the order but want to save it for later.

Here's a video walkthrough showing the entire order creation process:

### Editing Orders <a id="chapter-7"></a>
Sometimes you may need to edit an order, to go back and add some diagnosis codes or missing information.
To do this, you can just go to Orders Pending (All), find the Order you need to edit, and click "Edit"

### Approving Orders <a id="chapter-8"></a>
Depending on your lab's setup, you may be required to provide signatures in order to approve the order.
A patient signature as well as a provider signature is required in this case.

If you don't have the signatures option, approving orders is as simple as clicking "Approve Order."

Here's a video showing how to attach signatures to a requisition:

### Retrieving Reports
From the Reports menu, Select Patient Reports.

You will see a list of reports for each interface connected to the LIS. 
The Final report will be visible only if all required tests have been completed for the order.
