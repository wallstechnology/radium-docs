Radium LIS Admins can now Delete Reports

Users will need the "Restore Reports" permission to be able to delete reports and restore reports.

This process will show how to delete a report and restore it.
Step 1. Delete the report by finding the report from the "Reports" page and click the "Delete Report" button next to the report you want to delete. Once you enter a reason and click the "Delete Report" button again, you will see a confirmation message.
